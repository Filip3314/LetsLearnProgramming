## On Life

If you have a safe place to sleep, reasonable health and food in the fridge, you're probably living with surplus. You have enough breathing room to devote an hour to watching TV, or having an argument you don't need to have, or simply messing around online. You have time and leverage and technology and trust.  
For many people, this surplus is bigger than any human on Earth could have imagined just a hundred years ago.  
What will you spend it on? *If you're not drowning, you're a lifeguard.* -Seth Godin

And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” -Steve Jobs

A man with one watch is certain about time. A man with two watches isn't.

Maturity is knowing you were an idiot in the past.  
Wisdom is knowing that you'll be an idiot in the future.  
Common sense is knowing that you should try not to be an idiot NOW.  

"What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have never been discovered."

"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - Steve Jobs

“Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.” - Dr. Seuss

"One thing I know, that I know nothing. This is the source of my wisdom." - Socrates

People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content in mediocrity. - Andrew Carnegie

  Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
  Courage to change the things I can,  
  And wisdom to know the difference.  

"Comparison is the thief of joy"

“Fear None, Respect All” – Sun Tzu
