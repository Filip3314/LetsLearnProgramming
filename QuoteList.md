**note: needs some editing and cleaning**

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.

Everything is better when you decide you don't care.

I don’t believe in work-life balance, I believe in life’s work.

"Comparison is the thief of joy"

But here not any instrument whatever, not a utensil.
From nothing they must supply themselves with everything...
If the engineer could have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost.
The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every science
...a possessor of all human knowledge.
--Taken from: The Mysterious Island, by Jules Verne

“Fear None, Respect All” – Sun Tzu

To see the world, things dangerous to come to
to see behind walls, to draw closer,
to find each other and to feel.
That is the purpose of life.
-The Secret Life of Walter Mitty: LIFE motto

Be Confident, not arrogant.

Calm is contagious.

Preparation breeds confidence.
When you take the field knowing you are more prepared than your opponents, confidence ensues.
Confidence breeds success…

“If I can do something, to give myself even a small edge over the competition, I should do it.
Those small edges will begin to add up; those small edges will give me victory.”

"Just remember that if you're not working at your game to the utmost of your ability, there will be someone out there somewhere with equal ability who is.  And one day you'll play each other, and he'll have the advantage."

It is simply a question of commitment...
Are you sure that at the end of the year you will be able to truly say...
...we tried everything humanly possible?

"The secret of success is constancy to purpose."

"The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a man's determination."

“The measure of success is whether the people close to you are happy and love you.  It is also nice to feel like you made a difference - inventing something or raising kids or helping people in need.”  - Bill Gates + Warren Buffet

“Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call ‘life’ was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” -Steve Jobs

“My goal is not to fail fast. My goal is to succeed over the long run. They are not the same thing.” “To do original work: It’s not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe.”

Inspiration Exists, but it has to find you working. - Pablo Picasso

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

The pessimist complains about the wind, the optimist hopes that the wind will change...
the realist adjusts the sail.

We can never say we are fully prepared...
...until we've already succeeded.

"Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it."

"I find that the harder I work the more luck I seem to have." - Thomas Jefferson

Luck is bullshit. We make our own luck.

"May the nimblest robot win."

"Success always comes when preparation meets opportunity"

Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.

The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today's work superbly well.

Spectacular achievement is always preceded by unspectacular preparation.

"Nobody's a natural. You work hard to get good and then work to get better. It's hard to stay on top."

"Failure to prepare is preparing to fail."

"The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year."

"Leaders are problem solvers by talent and temperament, and by choice;
always leaning forward, pushing something invisible ahead of them."

"Never try to solve all the problems at once — make them line up for you one-by-one."

"Whatever failures I have known, whatever errors I have committed, whatever follies I have witnessed, have been the consequences of action without thought."

"Problems are only opportunities in work clothes."

"You don't drown by falling in the water; you drown by staying there."

"The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them."

"Commitment is the enemy of resistance, for it is the serious promise to press on, to get up, no matter how many times you are knocked down."

"The moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too.
All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise occurred.
A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all
manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could
have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.
Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."

"Desire is the key to motivation, but it's determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek."

"You've got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction."

"Keep away from people who belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great."

"Well begun is half done."

"When all think alike, then no one is thinking."

"It's easy to come up with new ideas; the hard part is letting go of what worked for you two years ago, but will soon be out of date."

"The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas."

"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."

"Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things."

"The innovation point is the pivotal moment when talented and motivated people seek the opportunity to act on their ideas and dreams."

"Up is never where you are now."

"illegitimi non carborundum" - Don't let the bastards wear you down.

The interesting thing about working “hard” is you can always work “harder.”
The coolest thing about being “good” is that you can always be “better”.

Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. - Leonardo DaVinci

Make your choice, adventurous Stranger;
Strike the bell and bide the danger,
Or wonder, til it drives you mad,
What would have followed if you had.

"The walls between art and engineering, exist only in our minds."

A man with one watch is certain about time. A man with two watches isn't.

“We do not rise to the level of our expectations. We fall to the level of our training.” —Archilochus

"You may know what you're looking for, but you never know what you're going to find."

A vote is a statement about the voter, not the candidate.

For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.

"My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure." - Abraham Lincoln

What are drawing boards for?  Going back and starting over.

To err is to engineer.

Maturity is knowing you were an idiot in the past.
Wisdom is knowing that you'll be an idiot in the future.
Common sense is knowing that you should try not to be an idiot NOW.

"What is a weed? A plant whose virtues have never been discovered."
--Ralph Waldo Emerson

Play until the buzzer sounds.

Strike First
Strike Hard
No Mercy
-Cobra Kai

"It's your ability to learn quickly and contribute quickly that matters." - Padmasree Warrior

Fail Again, Fail Better.

Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.

"When I am working on a problem I never think about beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong." - Buckminster Fuller

I may not be able to design a part but I sure know how to count beans.
I also know other people who count beans and what they want; as many beans in their pocket as possible.
So at the end of the day I hate giving them a bean, because I know I just lost one.

A ship is safe in the harbor, but that is not why ships are built.

You do not need consensus to tap into the wisdom of a crowd; the search for consensus only encourages tepid, lowest-common-denominator solutions which offend no one rather than exciting anyone.

Engineers:  They do what they must; use science when applicable, intuition when useful, and trial and error when necessary.

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;

There are three types of team players:
1 - Hard workers, who are positive influences. – They do everything for the good of the team.
2 - People who follow the examples of those around them.
3 - Goof offs, and negative influences. – Do whatever they WANT to do.
Everyone needs to choose what type of team player they are.

"Champions are champions not because they do anything extraordinary but because they do the ordinary things better than anyone else." —Chuck Knoll

When you're a winner you're always happy, but if you're happy as a loser… you'll always be a loser.

Knowledge is the one thing you keep even after you give it away.

"It's really a never-ending journey... The secret is to hate yourself and the work you produce.  If everything you make is trash, then you'll continually push yourself to produce something that won't fill you with shame.  If you're lucky, after a lifetime of self-doubt, maybe you'll produce something you can be proud of before you fall over dead." – Gabe, Penny Arcade

"The Ancestor of Every Action is Thought" - RW Emerson

Fight as if you are right, listen as if you are wrong.

We all have times when we think more effectively, and times when we should not be thinking at all.

Bailing water in a leaky boat diverts energy from rowing the boat.

"You know… Apple is like a ship.  That ship is loaded with treasure, but there's a hole in the ship.  And my job is to get everyone to row in the same direction." - Gil Amelio (who never fixed the hole)

I have never lost a wink of sleep about being unapologetically intolerant of anyone who refuses to show respect for those around them. – Robert Sutton

“Real Artists Ship” – Steve Jobs

Choosing which filters to apply, and when has much to do with successful innovation; it's not just having an open mind, it's also knowing when to postpone certain judgements, and then when to bring them back in. If a mind is always open, it never finishes anything; if a mind is never open, it never starts. – Scott Berkun

“If I had 20 days to solve a problem, I would take 19 days to define it.” – Einstein

“All children are born artists. The problem is to remain artist as we grow up.” – Picasso

“Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." -Charles Mingus

"We must strive to reach that simplicity that lies beyond sophistication." -John Gardner

“Weniger, aber besser.” - Less, but better. -Dieter Rams

Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone genius.

You can look at practically any part of anything manmade around you and think 'some engineer was frustrated while designing this.' It's a little human connection.

"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.” If your mind can conceive it then believe you can achieve it. Have the tenacity to create the extraordinary. - Einstein

The purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things.  - Rainer Maria Rilke

Faster, Faster, until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death. - Hunter S Thompson

It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan. - Eleanor Roosevelt

"Everyone Is a Genius"
..."But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid."

Why should I deem myself to be a chisel when I could be the artist?

‘All men’s miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.’ -Blaise Pascal

The best way to appreciate your job is to imagine yourself without one. - Oscar Wilde

The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary. - Donald Kendall

Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there. - Will Rogers

When I was young, I observed that nine out of ten things I did were failures. So I did ten times more work. - George Bernard Shaw

"This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture
still treat each guest honorably,
He may be cleaning you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond."
-- Rumi

Leave the world more interesting than it was before. - Neil Gaiman

"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." - Steve Jobs

"Pretend to be completely in control and people will assume that you are." - Steve Jobs

"People who know what they're talking about don't need Powerpoint." - Steve Jobs

If you are interested in the ultimate character of the physical world, or the complete world, and at the present time our only way to understand that is through a mathematical type of reasoning, then I don't think a person can fully appreciate, or in fact can appreciate much of, these particular aspects of the world, the great depth of character of the universality of the laws, the relationships of things, without an understanding of mathematics. I don't know any other way to do it, we don't know any other way to describe it accurately ... or to see the interrelationships without it. So I don't think a person who hasn't developed some mathematical sense is capable of fully appreciating this aspect of the world - don't misunderstand me, there are many, many aspects of the world that mathematics is unnecessary for, such as love, which are very delightful and wonderful to appreciate and to feel awed and mysterious about; and I don't mean to say that the only thing in the world is physics, but you were talking about physics and if that's what you're talking about, then to not know mathematics is a severe limitation in understanding the world. - Feynman

Do one thing every day that scares you.

You are the average of the five people you associate with the most.

As an engineer
I'm sort of a student of
how to make things work.

As an engineer
I'm sort of a student of
how things fall apart.

"Think not of the amount to be accomplished, the difficulties to be overcomes, or the end to be attained, but set earnestly at the little task at your elbow, letting that be sufficient for the day." -- Sir William Osler

I felt like we had a secret, just the two of us. Like that thing where you just wanna be with one person all the time. You feel like the two of you get something no one else gets.

There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.

If you're not saying "hell yeah!" to something, then say "no.”

“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.”

“The cliche mix of genius and asshole.”

Revel in the joy that comes from solving difficult problems, and always celebrate your failures as opportunities for improvement. As long as you continue to grow as a life-long learner, I have no doubt you will be successful!

Love is free, but everyone is trying to buy it anyway.

If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. - Reid Hoffman

No man ever listened himself out of a job. - Calvin Coolidge

“There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.”  - Marshall Mcluhan

“There are three things we cry for in life: things that are lost, things that are found, and things that are magnificent.”  - Douglas Coupland

“We’re all just walking each other home.” - Ram Dass

“Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple.” - Dr. Seuss

“Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can.Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

“I came to New York because I heard the streets were paved with gold,” the 19th-century immigrant lament began. “When I got here, I learned three things: The streets are not paved with gold. They are not paved at all. I am expected to pave them.”

The point is, any system in which humans are involved will at some point be disrupted by human error. Organizations distinguish themselves not by stamping out the possibility of error, but by handling the inevitable mistake well.

It’s not that we have too short a time to live, but that we squander a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and it’s given in sufficient measure to do many great things if we spend it well. But when it’s poured down the drain of luxury and neglect, when it’s employed to no good end, we’re finally driven to see that it has passed by before we even recognized it passing. And so it is – we don’t receive a short life, we make it so. - Seneca

What the Stoics are saying is so much of what worries us are things that we have no control over. If I’m doing something tomorrow and I’m worried about it raining and ruining it, no amount of me stressing about it is going to change whether it rains or not. The Stoics are saying, “Not only are you going to be happier if you can make the distinction between what you can change and can’t change but if you focus your energy exclusively on what you can change, you’re going to be a lot more productive and effective as well.”

We all have work to do. Do good work. Do creative work. Do thoughtful work. Do your best. But there’s no need to flatter yourself about how hard it was.

If you live near a Whole Foods, if no one in your family serves in the military, if you’re paid by the year, not the hour, if most people you know finished college, if no one you know uses meth, if you married once and remain married, if you’re not one of 65 million Americans with a criminal record — if any or all of these things describe you, then accept the possibility that actually, you may not know what’s going on and you may be part of the problem.

“What might you do to accomplish your 10-year goals in the next 6 months, if you had a gun against your head?”

People who are unable to motivate themselves must be content in mediocrity. - Andrew Carnegie

“Everything alive is either growing or dying.”

They come back to read us, don’t you see? It was from us they learnt the secret of life: that we grow old without growing wise. They realized that nothing happened when we grew up: no blinding light on the road to Damascus, no sudden feeling of maturity.

Restlessness is discontent and discontent is the first necessity of progress. Show me a thoroughly satisfied man and I will show you a failure. - Edison

I think a lot can be said with a raised eyebrow...

“I am an old man and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.” —Mark Twain 

“He who suffers before it is necessary suffers more than is necessary.” —Seneca

Don’t Attribute to Malice That Which Can Be Explained Otherwise

“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect.” — Mark Twain.

 “I lost my republic-- or rather, I learned how to live in tyranny. I faced loss after loss in battle-- or rather, I learned how to fight until the end for liberty. If you think these things have made me weaker, you are mistaken. What you have tried to throw at me cannot even injure me, and instead, only makes me more ready to do my task.” - Cato

“A person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.”

If I’m not a little bit nauseous when I’m done, I probably didn’t show up like I should have shown up.”

"I’m there to learn. I’m not there to win; I’m there to learn, because then I’ll win, eventually. . . ." - Robert Rodriguez

The trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism. - Norman Vincent Peale

"One thing I know, that I know nothing. This is the source of my wisdom." - Socrates

In business and in life, never believe your own body odor is perfume. - Haimchinkel Malintz Anaynikal (Alan Greenberg)

Don’t let your “Yoga Races” stress you out - Are there places you feel like you're falling behind where there's actually no race? - Seth Godin

Ask yourself… ‘what is my moonshot?’ - What achievement are you striving towards that is not only barely beyond your reach, but instead almost beyond your comprehension?  What if you had to achieve it today?  Tomorrow?  Within the next month?  What if you had to accomplish your 10 year goals within the next 6 months?  Do you have 10 year goals?  Without them, how do you expect to get anywhere?  What is your moonshot?

What is your personal narrative?  What is the story of your life which you tell yourself?  Is it the same one you tell others?  We all live for narratives - we love to assign meaning to every action, and believe the effects are caused by the causes.  The secret is… we all get to decide what our narrative is.  We get to make it whatever we want.  The excuse you give for your failures, can become the reason for your triumph… in the right story.

Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.  All this noise and rush and stress seem contriver to drown out or cover up some fear at the center of our lives.

If you have a safe place to sleep, reasonable health and food in the fridge, you're probably living with surplus. You have enough breathing room to devote an hour to watching TV, or having an argument you don't need to have, or simply messing around online. You have time and leverage and technology and trust.
For many people, this surplus is bigger than any human on Earth could have imagined just a hundred years ago.
What will you spend it on? *If you're not drowning, you're a lifeguard.* -Seth Godin

Sonder is defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours.  Sonder might happen to you. When it does, it will help you see the world in a whole new way. Because, if you let it, the feeling can persist. A feeling that can allow you to see others the way you'd like to be seen. - Seth Godin

Change is a word...for a journey with stress.  You get the journey and you get the stress. At the end, you’re a different person. But both elements are part of the deal. - Seth Godin

The cult of individual personalities is always, in my view, unjustified… It strikes me as unfair, and even in bad taste, to select a few for boundless admiration, attributing superhuman powers of mind and character to them. This has been my fate, and the contrast between the popular estimate of my achievements and the reality is simply grotesque. This extraordinary state of affairs would be unbearable but for one great consoling thought: it is a welcome symptom in an age, which is commonly denounced as materialistic, that it makes heroes of men whose ambitions lie wholly in the intellectual and moral sphere. - Albert Einstein

“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” - Benjamin Franklin
