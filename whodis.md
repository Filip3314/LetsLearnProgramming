## About

### Who is Katie?

I'm a computer engineer working at [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/). I write firmware for sensors and other products to enable student learning.

I am also involed in FIRST Robotics. I was a student on FRC 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and with two other students started FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating. After graduation I moved to Texas to work at VEX and started mentoring FRC 1296. 
One time Spectrum asked me questions about FRC and my job, which you can find [here](http://blog.spectrum3847.org/2016/10/katie-widen-this-is-how-i-work.html).

Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting and playing various musical instruments.

### Why Lets Learn Programming?

After a season with 1296, I was unhappy with our training system for new programmers and started creating the Lets Learn Programming (LLP) series. Having been a TA for Iowa State's "Intro to C" courses for nearly 4 years, I have a good grasp on how to teach newbies how to program. I used my experience as a TA and the structure of the hands-on labs to develop LLP.

Currently LLP is written with 1296's 2017 robot in mind. As LLP grows and evolves, it will become a broader tool for instruction that can be used by others not affiliated with 1296.

### I have a suggestion for an improvement/correction

I'm always looking for ways to improve my teaching resources. If you found something incorrect, typo'd, or needs improving you can either submit an issue on github or email me at knwiden at gmail dot com.
