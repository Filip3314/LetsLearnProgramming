## About

### Who is Katie?

I'm a computer engineer working at [VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com/). I write firmware for sensors and other products to enable student learning.

I am also involed in FIRST Robotics. I was a student on FRC 1675 in Milwaukee, WI. After graduating high school, I went to Iowa State University and with two other students started FRC 3928. I mentored 3928 for three years before taking a break to focus on graduating. After graduation I moved to Texas to work at VEX and started mentoring FRC 1296. 
One time Spectrum asked me questions about FRC and my job, which you can find [here](http://blog.spectrum3847.org/2016/10/katie-widen-this-is-how-i-work.html). I frequent Chief Delphi under the username [Katie_UPS](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=25036).

Besides the engineering stuff, I have a [very cute dog](https://www.instagram.com/gatsbypaws/) who accompanies me on backpacking and camping trips. I also enjoy creative pursuits such as painting and playing various musical instruments.

### Why Lets Learn Programming?
Training programmers to be prepared for FRC can be difficult. Students come in with different levels of experience and no matter what pace you pick, you are too fast for some students and too slow for others. Lets Learn Programming (LLP) is my solution for having students learn everything from 0 to Robot at their own pace. I used my years of experience as a TA for Iowa State's "Intro to C" courses and the structure of the hands-on labs to develop LLP.

There are two divisions of LLP - Basics and Robots. The Basics tutorials give students a basic set of programming skills for them to successfully write code for robots. Any student with a computer and internet access can walk through The Basics due to all the code development and compliling being run on ideone.com. No installation required.

LLP Robots is for students who have a base of programming knowledge and the correct tools for writing and deploying C++ code for FRC robots. Currently LLP Robots is written with 1296's 2017 robot as "the robot". As LLP grows and evolves, it will become a broader tool for instruction that can be used by others not affiliated with 1296.

### Have a suggestion for an improvement or correction?

I'm always looking for ways to improve my teaching resources. If you found something incorrect, typo'd, or needs improving you can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/kwiden/LetsLearnProgramming/issues) on github or email me at knwiden at gmail dot com.
