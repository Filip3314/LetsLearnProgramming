**Objectives**: Learn about while loops and for loops

**Process**: 

Loops are everywhere in life, you just may not realize it. A loop can loosely be defined as "something that repeats with or without small changes each time."

Common examples of loops include:
* Counting: "One, two, three, four..."
* Music: "My name is no, my number is no, my sign is no..."
* Brushing your Teeth: "My toothpaste lasts two weeks. Until the toothpaste runs out, I can brush my teeth."
* Using your Phone: "While my battery is more than 0%, I can watch YouTube."

Can you think of any other loops you see everyday?

Let's try counting in code. Let's start with [this code](https://ideone.com/t4YjmL).

"Oh, that's only five lines of code! That's not bad!"

Oh contrair, young pupil, what if I asked you to count to one hundred? One thousand? Four thousand ninety-six?

"But that's... a lot of lines of code! Ain't nobody got time for that!"

There are these amazing things in code called *for loops* and *while loops*! For now, let's start with for loops.
