## Let's Loop de Loop!

**Objectives**: Learn about while loops and for loops

**Process**: 

Loops are everywhere in life, you just may not realize it. A loop can loosely be defined as "something that repeats with or without small changes each time."

Common examples of loops include:
* Counting: "One, two, three, four..."
* Music: "My name is no, my number is no, my sign is no..."
* Brushing your Teeth: "My toothpaste lasts two weeks. Until the toothpaste runs out, I can brush my teeth."
* Using your Phone: "While my battery is more than 0%, I can watch YouTube."

Can you think of any other loops you see everyday?

Let's try counting in code. Let's start with [this code](https://ideone.com/t4YjmL).

"Oh, that's only five lines of code! That's not bad!"

Oh contrair, young pupil, what if I asked you to count to one hundred? One thousand? Four thousand ninety-six?

"But that's... a lot of lines of code! Ain't nobody got time for that!"

There are these amazing things in code called *for loops* and *while loops*! For now, let's start with for loops.

Take a look at [this code](https://ideone.com/OyduQ8).

Run the code. What do you notice with the output?

Let's take a closer look at this line: `for (int i = 1; i <= 5; ++i)`

First, the keyword `for` lets C++ know that this is a for loop.

Next, the `int i = 1` declares a new integer to be used as a counter for the loop. (Katie pls edit)

Then, the `i <= 5` limits the for loop by setting a bound for the integer.

Lastly, the `++i` tells the code to increment `i` by one at the conclusion of each [iteration](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3821/iteration) of the loop.

Now, try changing the code to count to ten by twos. 

//word problem that involves using for loops

Now, Andy, Anna, and Katie are playing the game "3, 6, 9." The rules of the game are as follows:
* Players take turns saying a number, increasing by one each time
* If a number has a 3, 6, or 9 in any position, the player claps instead of saying a number
* If a number has more than one of 3, 6, or 9, the player claps the amount of times those numbers appear (i.e. 36 = two claps)

Andy, Anna, and Katie aren't very good at this game. They only made it to thirty before messing up! If they had all three played the game correctly, have the computer output what they should have said.
