## Let's Reorganize!
[<- Previously: Let's Learn PID!](LLpid.md)

**Objectives** : Learn how to create our own objects, learn a little bit about 1296's messaging system, clean up our code to be more readable


**Task** : Create objects for each subsystem using a template,


**Starting Point** - Your code from last time and a few files (I recommend opening these in new tabs):

 -[Component.h](frc1296code/Component.h)
 
 -[Component.cpp](frc1296code/Component.cpp)
 
 -[ComponentBase.h](frc1296code/ComponentBase.h)
 
 -[ComponentBase.cpp](frc1296code/ComponentBase.cpp)
 
 -[RHSRobot 2017 Code](https://github.com/FRC1296/RhsRobot2017)
 

**Process** - 

1. Look at your code, now look at the 2017 robot code. 2017 code is the code your code could be.

2. As a group lets talk about messaging.

3. Make an object (.c and .h files) for every subsystem, ie drivetrain, arm, etc. Use Component.h and Component.cpp as your bases and replace where it says "Component" with the name of your object (ie drivetrain), but not where it says ComponentBase. For example check out what I did for [Katie.cpp](frc1296code/Katie.cpp) and [Katie.h](frc1296code/Katie.h).
